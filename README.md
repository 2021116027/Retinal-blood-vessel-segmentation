# 🧠 Retinal Blood Vessel Segmentation for Diabetic Retinopathy Detection

## 📚 Project Overview
This project aims to automate the segmentation of blood vessels in retinal fundus images to support early diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy. We explored and compared multiple image processing techniques including:
- Kirsch Edge Detection
- Kirsch + Fuzzy C-Means Clustering (FCM)
- Matched Filtering
- Multi-Scale Line Detection (MSLD)

The segmentation was validated using the DRIVE dataset and metrics like DSC, Jaccard Index, Sensitivity, Specificity, and F1-Score.
